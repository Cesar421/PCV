part2.2
If x' and y do not lie on l', it could be due to:

Numerical Inaccuracies: Small errors from rotation and scaling transformations.
Inconsistent Transformations: Slight mismatches in how transformations are applied to the points versus the line.
Order of Transformations: If the order (translation, rotation, scaling) differs between the points and line, it can lead to misalignment.
